# Text Summarizer
## Progess: ![](https://geps.dev/progress/90)
Welcome to the Text Summarizer project! This project focuses on developing a system for automatic text summarization using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and algorithms.

## Overview

- **Objective:** Generate concise and meaningful summaries of given text documents.
- **Techniques Used:**
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  - Python with NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and PageRank algorithm

## Project Highlights

1. **Text Summarization:**
   - Developed a robust text summarization system using NLP techniques.
   - Implemented the PageRank algorithm for extracting key sentences.

2. **NLP Techniques:**
   - Leveraged NLP methods for pre-processing text data.
   - Explored algorithms for identifying and extracting essential information.

3. **PageRank Algorithm:**
   - Applied the PageRank algorithm to rank sentences and select the most important ones for the summary.
